- **Requirement Analysis & Planning:**
    - Define user personas (e.g., Novice Investor, Day Trader).
    - Comply with financial regulations (e.g., KYC, AML) and data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).
    - Specify functional requirements: real-time market data, various order types (market, limit), portfolio tracking, and secure account funding.
    - Set non-functional requirements: low-latency performance, high security (encryption, MFA), and scalability.
- **Architecture & Design:**
    - Design a microservices architecture for independent, scalable components (e.g., Order Service, User Service).
    - Implement a real-time data processing pipeline using message queues (e.g., Kafka) and WebSockets for client updates.
    - Design a robust database schema optimized for high-volume transactions and real-time data retrieval.
    - Plan for cloud deployment on a major provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) using services like Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **Development:**
    - **Front-end:** Build an intuitive trading dashboard with real-time charts, order forms, and portfolio views.
    - **Back-end:** Develop a reliable order matching engine, integrate with market data APIs, and implement risk management logic.
    - Implement secure user authentication (including MFA) and API gateways.
- **Testing:**
    - Conduct comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for all services.
    - Perform performance and load testing to simulate high trading volumes and ensure system stability.
    - Execute security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scans) to protect user data and assets.
    - Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with a select group of users.
- **CI/CD & Deployment:**
    - Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like GitLab CI or GitHub Actions.
    - Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for automated deployment and scaling.
    - Implement a monitoring and logging solution (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track system health in production.
- **Production & Maintenance:**
    - Deploy the platform to a secure cloud environment.
    - Establish a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity.
    - Set up an ongoing maintenance schedule for security patches, software updates, and new feature releases.
    - Provide a robust customer support system for user inquiries and technical issues.
